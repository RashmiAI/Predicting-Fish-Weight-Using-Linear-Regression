# 🐟 Fish Weight Prediction - Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to use linear regression to predict the weight of different fish species based on their physical measurements using the Fish Market dataset.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to:

- Build a linear regression model to predict fish weight.
- Analyze the relationships between fish dimensions and their weight.
- Apply exploratory data analysis techniques for insights.
- Evaluate the model using regression metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² Score.
- Visualize the regression performance with plots.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📂 Files Included

- `Fish_Linear_Regression.ipynb`: Main notebook with data loading, EDA, modeling, and evaluation.
- `fish_data.csv`: Dataset containing features and target variable (fish weight).

## 🔍 Workflow Summary

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Load dataset from CSV
   - Handle missing values (if any)
   - Basic info and data types check

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understand distribution of variables
   - Correlation heatmaps and pairplots

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Feature selection and encoding (if needed)
   - Train-test split
   - Scaling features using `StandardScaler`

4. **Model Training**
   - Fit a `LinearRegression` model from Scikit-learn

5. **Prediction and Evaluation**
   - Evaluate model with MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²
   - Visualize predicted vs actual values

## 📊 Results

- **Model:** Linear Regression
- **R² Score:** ~0.90+
- **Visuals:** Regression line, residual plot
- **Conclusion:** Model captures a strong relationship between dimensions and weight
